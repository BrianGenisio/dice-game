I've wanted to build an game for a while now.  There's this game I like to play with my family.  It's an older game called [Fill or Bust](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193/fill-or-bust).  It's a simple but fun multi-player dice game that has you make small decisions to earn big points.  There's another game that I've been enjoying these days called [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/). It is a solitare rogue-like game with poker mechanics.  I've spent housrs playing this game.

I want to make a game that is inspired by both games.  A multi-player dice game with modifiers that help people build small engines to score points and win.

## Pass the Cheese
Pass the Cheese is the name of the game.  A fun web-based, multi-player game for people to pick quickly and play quickly. I'll start with the dice and then I'll move to the cards.  I'd like the cards to have cheese-themed art so I'll use DALL-E to generate the card art.
