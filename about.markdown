## Whoami?
My name is Brian Genisio.  I've been a software developer for well over 25 years and I've seen the industry change a lot in that time.  These days, I'm a Technical Engineering Manager at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) but I've worked at a lot of places in my career.

## What am I doing?
I'm building a game with AI.  And I'm blogging about it.
